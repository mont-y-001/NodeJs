//Their are 2 script: Start and Test


#Express js = express js ek npm package h and it's a framework
-express js manages everything from recieving the request and giving the response

*framework(flow) => framework is flow of doing something or we can say that we have to foloow to steps in framework

//imp
*next(new Error(...)) =>	Tells Express to skip normal route and handle error
*res.send("...")	 => Sends a normal page response to the user

#Session Cookoies => hum log kuch bji data frontend par browser par rakh sakte hai and jab bhi aap kuch bhi request backend par karoge wo frontend par save data automatically backend par chala jayega

ex- hum insta pr koi activity krenge server humse puchega app kon means login krne ke liye bolega ,now we have to login to do some activity if i wants to do again i server again ask me to login "so in this case cookies are saved on our broweser that have some code or string which also server have so we can do anything without login or signup"
